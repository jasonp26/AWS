Step Four:    Begin writing your Ansible .yml file that will create your instance on the AWS environment

I first created the following folder structure on my Linux Server inside the already created Ansible directory.

$ /etc/ansible
$     .. /development/ansible-aws/

Under ansible-aws
$ .. /inventory/
$             .. hosts (create this file in inventory)
$ .. /playbooks/
$             .. demo_setup.yml (create this file in playbooks)

***************************************************************************************
** Contents of the HOSTS File **
***************************************************************************************

[local]
localhost

***************************************************************************************
** Contents of my demo_setup.yml file **
***************************************************************************************
# Demo Setup.yml

- name: My Demo EC2 for AWS
  hosts: localhost
  connection: local
  gather_facts: False
  vars:
    keypair: id_rsa
    instance_type: t2.micro
    ami_id: [insert your desired ami id here ]
    region: [choose your region here i used us-west-1 for this example]
  tasks:
    - name: Create an Instance using RHEL7
      ec2:
         key_name: "{{ keypair }}"
         group: default
         instance_type: "{{ instance_type  }}"
         image: "{{ ami_id }}"
         wait: true
         region: "{{ region }}"
         aws_access_key: [insert your access key id here]
         aws_secret_key: [insert your secret access key here]
      register: ec2
    - name: Print all EC2 Variables
      debug: var=ec2

***************************************************************************************

NOTE: "{{ keypair}}" . This is a referencing the variable that was declared at the top of this yml file.  Look over this code carfeully and if you like watch the video on youtube that I have linked in my README file.

Now that you have completed the above you are now going to run the file, Please NOTE I had a few errors along the way to get this running simply because it would not create the instance in the EU region so had to use a US one.
